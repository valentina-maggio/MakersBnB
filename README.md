You can not view any page on the site if you have not signed in. 

From the homepage, you can filter spaces that are available during your specified date range. 

You can click on any space to request to book it for a night.

You can also add a space that you own via the 'Add Listing' button. You will not see this space on the list of available spaces as you cannot book a space that you own.

Click 'My requests' to see any spaces that you have requested bookings for, and any of **your** spaces that **other users** have requested bookings for.

From the 'My Requests' page you can confirm or reject any requests for bookings for your properties. The user will see this updated on their 'My requests' page when they log in.
